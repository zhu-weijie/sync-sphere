### **Project Requirement Document (PRD): SyncSphere**

*   **Version:** v1.0.0
*   **Date:** 2025-09-24

#### **1. Overview**

*   **Project Name:** SyncSphere
*   **Project Description:** A robust, cross-platform file sharing and synchronization service designed for high availability and reliability.
*   **Vision:** To provide a seamless "cloud drive" experience where users can effortlessly synchronize, share, and collaborate on their files across multiple devices, with a strong emphasis on reliability and ease of use.

#### **2. Target Audience**

*   **Primary:** Individual professionals and students who need to access and work on their documents across multiple devices (e.g., laptop, phone, tablet).
*   **Secondary:** Small teams looking for a simple way to share and collaborate on a common set of files without the complexity of enterprise-level systems.

#### **3. Functional Requirements (FRs)**

**3.1. Core File & Account Management**
| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR-1 | Secure User Authentication | Users must be able to sign up, log in, and log out. Authentication must support email/password and at least one OAuth 2.0 provider (e.g., Google). |
| FR-2 | File & Folder CRUD Operations | Users can upload, download, create folders, rename, move, and delete files and folders through client applications. |

**3.2. Synchronization**
| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR-3 | Automated Cross-Device Sync | Changes (creations, modifications, deletions) made on one device must be automatically propagated to all other devices linked to the same account. |
| FR-4 | Offline Access & Sync | Users can access and modify locally synced files while offline. Changes are queued and synchronized automatically upon reconnection. |
| FR-5 | Conflict Resolution | If a file is modified offline on two separate devices, the system must save both versions upon reconnection. The second version to sync will be renamed (e.g., `filename (conflicted copy).txt`) to prevent data loss. The user will be notified of the conflict. |

**3.3. Sharing & Collaboration**
| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR-6 | Basic File Sharing | Users can generate a secure, shareable link for any file, allowing anyone with the link to view and download the file. |
| FR-7 | File Version History | The system will automatically save a history of file changes. Users can view and restore file versions from the last **30 days**. |

#### **4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

| ID | Requirement | Metric/Description | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| NFR-1 | **Availability & Durability** | **API Availability:** 99.95% uptime. <br> **Data Durability:** 99.999999999% (11 nines). <br> The system must prioritize availability over strict consistency (AP model in CAP theorem). | Critical |
| NFR-2 | **Performance & Latency** | **Sync Latency:** P99 latency for a metadata change to propagate to other clients must be **< 20 seconds**. <br> **Upload/Download Speed:** Must support transfer speeds of at least **10 MB/s** for a single large file, network conditions permitting. | High |
| NFR-3 | **Scalability** | **User Base:** Support up to **100 million** total registered users with **20 million Daily Active Users (DAU)**. <br> **Storage:** Support a total of **100 Petabytes** of data. <br> **File Size:** Support individual file uploads up to **10 GB**. | High |
| NFR-4 | **Security** | **Encryption in Transit:** All client-server communication must use TLS 1.2 or higher. <br> **Encryption at Rest:** All user files stored on the server must be encrypted using AES-256. | Critical |
| NFR-5 | **Consistency** | The system will operate on an **Eventual Consistency** model. While file changes will propagate quickly, there is no guarantee of immediate, system-wide consistency after an update. | Medium |

#### **5. Out of Scope for v1.0.0**

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the initial release to ensure a focused and timely delivery of the core product.
*   Advanced sharing permissions (e.g., view-only, edit access, password-protected links).
*   Full-text search within documents.
*   Selective sync (choosing specific folders to sync on a device).
*   Admin dashboards and enterprise features.
*   In-app document editing or previews.
